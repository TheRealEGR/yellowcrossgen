# Pokémon Yellow [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow. This particular version adds the crossgen evolutions, plus updating the Pokemon sprites to Gen 2, and some QOL. This is still a WIP and there are gonna be some changes later.
Note: I have´t passed this to rgbds 0.8.0, so you would need rgbds 0.7.0 or 0.6.1 to build this.
It builds the following ROMs:

- Pokemon Yellow (UE) [C][!].gbc  `sha1: cc7d03262ebfaf2f06772c1a480c7d9d5f4a38e1`
- YELLMONS.GB (debug build) `sha1: d44e96eddfbdad633cbe4e6e64915e9e198974b0`
- Dmgapse0.h08.patch `sha1: f3346a5559d52c296b8feab0cdbbfb0e250ac161`

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).
